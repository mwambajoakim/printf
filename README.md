# <ins>Printf</ins>

## Introduction
The function that is probably used the most in C programming to print out characters on to the stdout, could be the console or screen, and it also embodies a lot of the knowledge that C has. For example the ue of loops and pointers, the use of variadic functions, the use of structs and all manner of C syntax in order to implement it.

In this project I will make this function from scratch. I will use the different things I have learnt so far to do a deep dive and understand how things work in C. Hopefully, I will manage to write the whole function, handling everything that needs handling. In here I document everything that I do towards making the function work. The idea is to have simple code that does complex stuff.
